This project was started from the **clean** code of [**react-boilerplate**](https://www.reactboilerplate.com/)

> Please note that this boilerplate is production-ready and not meant for beginners! If you're just starting out with react or redux, please refer to https://github.com/petehunt/react-howto instead. If you want a solid, battle-tested base to build your next product upon and have some experience with react, this is the perfect start for you.

# The Quickstart I followed to setup the project: 
1. Make sure that you have _Node.js v8.10_ and _npm v5_ or above installed.
2. Clone this repo using `git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate.git <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>`
3. Move to the appropriate directory: `cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>`.
4. Run `npm run setup` in order to install dependencies and clean the git repo.
   _At this point you can run `npm start` to see the example app at` http://localhost:3000.`_
5. Run `npm run clean` to delete the example app.
